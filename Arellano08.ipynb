    "- Risk averse identical agents/citizens in a country, (assume there is a representitative agent) having Î² time discounting.\n",

    "- Foreign creditors are risk neutral and have deep pocket (i.e. can buy or sell as much asset as they want). Their time discounting is $\\frac{1}{(1+r)}$.\n",
    "- One risk free (exogenously risk free) foreign asset. (**Exogenously incomplete market**)\n",
    "- The government can default on its debt at the beginning of the period after seeing its endowment shock. (**Endogenously incomplete market**)\n",
    "- If government decides to default, he will be penalized by a default output $h(y)$ until he gets forgiven by the international market.\n",
